# Order Type Enhancements - Implementation Complete

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive order type enhancements implemented to replace the previous forced "MARKET" order constraints with intelligent, dynamic order type selection based on market conditions and AI analysis.

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. ✅ Removed Forced MARKET Order Constraints

- Integrated dynamic order type selection service
- Updated trade record creation to use actual order types
- Enhanced logging to show order type reasoning

**Before**:

```typescript
orderType: "MARKET", // Force MARKET for reliability
```

**After**:

```typescript
orderType: orderTypeRecommendation.orderType, // Dynamic based on AI analysis
```
