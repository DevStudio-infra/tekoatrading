- Data returned from API calls

### Manual Testing

You can also run individual test functions:

```typescript
import { quickTest } from "./src/tests/quick-capital-test";
quickTest();
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Even though tests run in demo mode, they create real API calls and positions. Always verify demo mode is enabled.

‚úÖ **Safe**: The tests use very small position sizes (0.001 units) and automatically clean up.

üîç **Monitoring**: Check the test output for any failures or warnings about your trading setup.

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Capital.com credentials
3. Ensure the Capital.com API is accessible
4. Check if markets are open (use crypto pairs for 24/7 trading)
5. Verify account has sufficient balance

### Performance Issues

1. Tests may take 1-2 minutes to complete
2. Network latency affects test duration
3. API rate limits may slow down tests

### Integration Issues

1. Ensure all backend services are running
2. Check database connectivity
3. Verify all dependencies are installed

## Support

If tests fail consistently:

1. Check the Capital.com API status
2. Verify your account credentials
3. Review the error logs
4. Check network connectivity
5. Ensure demo mode is working
